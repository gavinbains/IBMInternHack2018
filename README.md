See Sherlock.pdf for problem-solution statements

Be sure to add your API keys to the AuthInfoConstant_EMPTY.java and rename it to AuthInfoConstant.java before you deployt or it will not work. -- You will need Watson Understanding API, IBM Cloud, and Diffbot keys.

Here's an API reference of Watson Understanding: https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/natural-language-understanding/api/v1/

Follow the Serverless IBM Cloud tutorial (https://console.bluemix.net/docs/tutorials/serverless-api-webapp.html#serverless-web-application-and-api) for more infor about IBM Cloud and deploying the app. 

--Under DBProcessorUtil.java replace what_the_hack in the URL with your db name! (In the tutorial above it is "guestbook")

You can also make your own scrapers instead of using our Diffbot!
